     <h2>After returning to Ayodhya Rama celebrated Vijaya (victory) as he won the spiritual war. He became the king of Ayodhya and lived happily with Sita for a long time. Meanwhile, despite the ordeal, various rumors about Sita started spreading in Ayodhya. Disturbed by all these rumors, Rama sent Sita into exile.
The child-bearing Sita took refuge in the ashram of sage Valmiki. There his twin sons Luv and Kush were born. Luv and Kush did not know about their ancestry. They accepted Valmiki’s discipleship.
Valmiki taught Ramayana Geet (songs) to Luv and Kush. In the meantime, when Rama arranged the Ashwamedha Yajna, Valmiki came to the Yajna site with Luv and Kush. Luv and Kush sang the melancholic song of Ramayana. Rama was saddened to hear the song of Sita’s banishment. Then Valmiki brought Sita in front of Rama. But when Rama asked Sita to re-examine him in front of everyone, the insulted Sita called out to Mother Earth. The soil was cracked. Goddess Dharitri got up and went to the underworld with Sita. Thus Sita Mata’s Patal Pravesh (entering into the earth) happened. Then Rama realized that Luv and Kush were actually his children.
